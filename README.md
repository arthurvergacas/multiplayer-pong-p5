<h1>A multiplayer pong game made with p5 and node.js</h1>

<p>This simple pong game was made using <a href = "https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> and the socket.io library. However, the game still have some issues with responsiveness, and can sometimes lag and permit that the two players have different games in just one session.</p>
<p>This project was made just for gain better understanding about node.js and socket.io.</p>
